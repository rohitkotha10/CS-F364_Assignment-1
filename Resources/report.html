    <ul>
      <li>Tested on <code>Windows</code> using <code>Visual Studio</code> with
        <code>C++ Desktop Environment</code>
      </li>
      <li>Freeglut library is statically linked for the visualizer to run</li>
      <li>All additional include directories and libraries can be found in the <code>dependencies</code> folder
      </li>
      <li>Build the project with visual studio and press F5 to debug the application within visual studio itself
      </li>
      <li>First a blank window appears in which you are expected to draw a convex polygon with left clicks</li>
      <li>When you are done right click on the screen and then the polygon automatically closes itself with the
        last edge joining first</li>
      <li>After completing, close the window.</li>
      <li>Now in a while, the input will be processed and the decomposed polygon is shown on the screen on a new
        window</li>
      <li>The output is also written to a text file</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here is a sample output from the application</p>

    <h2 id="visualizer">Visualizer</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Visualizer was made using freeglut</li>
      <li>I was able to test the algorithm on only small test cases with vertices from 20-30.</li>
      <li>The visualizer I had made it easy to test on some edge cases and correct my implementation</li>
      <li>The Test Polygons were drawn in my visulaizers and immediately checked</li>
      <li>Note that You can run the decomposer either by drawing it in the visualizer app or by giving a file with
        the data as input</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="design-discussion">Design Discussion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I faced some trouble for adding an edge into my DCEL data structure</li>
      <li>The way I traverse my polygon is by traversing the edges within the same incident face</li>
      <li>When I add an Edge, the face associations change due to addition of a new face and a removal of a part
        of the old</li>
      <li>Because of this I was able to find that I was just looping through the same face and not able to go
        forward</li>
      <li>Initially I tried to reference the vertices to join to add an edge</li>
      <li>But It was better to reference the edges to determine which vertices to join (the edges origin)</li>
      <li>By using edges, it becomes simpler to change the face associations while adding an edge because a single
        vertex might be associated with many faces and edges</li>
      <li>So to get the face or edge I need from the vertex would be difficult</li>
      <li>But in an edge only one face and one vertex is associated, hence I decided to use the edges to traverse
        the polygon instead of vertices</li>
      <li>The add edge function in my DCEL structure only proceeds if two of the vertices to be joined belong to
        the same face</li>
    </ul>
